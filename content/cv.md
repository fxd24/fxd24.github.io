# CV Content

## Intro catcher

3+ years building LLM-powered knowledge systems. 6+ year building professional software. I turn complex problems into solutions that customers really want. Contrary to some engineers, I love diving deep with users and customers to truly understand their challenges. I embrace learning whatever it takes to get the job done and will go the extra mile to deliver results. Interested so far?

Next, you find highlights of solutions I have worked that I believe will add value to your company. You also will find a timeline, a skills matrix to show where my strength are. You can also explore posts on my website and projects on my GitHub account.

## Professional Highlights

## Research Topic Discovery & Expert Matching System

**Challenge:** A leading scientific publisher struggled to identify emerging research trends and find relevant experts among 200+ million research papers. This is a process that took weeks of manual work.

**Solution:** Built the "Research Topic Launcher," an end-to-end ML system that automates research trend analysis and expert identification in large text corpuses.

**Key Components:**
- **Recommender Engine:** Recommends relevant papers and top-ranked experts based on a research topic (complex text query), streamlining discovery and expert matching for editorial or collaboration needs.
- **Custom Semantic Search**: Pioneered a semantic search system that combines custom knowledge graphs with embedding models to deliver highly relevant results for complex queries
- **Research Knowledge Graph:** Constructed from research papers, citations, and more to map research relationships
- **LLM-Powered Topic Modeling**: Built system to generate hierarchical topic graphs from user queries, creating subtopics at configurable depths
- **Trend Analysis Engine:** Identifies emerging research topics using custom trend detection algorithms  

**My Technical Contributions:**
- **ML System Architecture:** Designed and prototyped the initial recommender architecture and knowledge graph structure from ideation to core recommendation engine 
- **Embedding models:** Evaluated and implemented embedding models for 2M+ research papers to deliver the best recommendation for our use case  (discovering that benchmark performance doesn't guarantee domain-specific success)
- **Novel ML System**: Built an integrated system combining custom knowledge graphs, research data, and embedding models to create capabilities that didn't exist before. I engineered new solutions from multiple ML components
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built data pipelines for ingestion, processing, and model inference designed for scale from the start
- **Validation & Benchmarking:** Created domain-specific benchmarks and transitioned from expert validation to standardized evaluation
- **Algorithm Development:** Developed trend detection algorithms validated by field experts


**Impact:** Reduced research topic discovery from weeks to minutes. 90% user preference rate for system recommendations over previous methods.
**Impact & Validation**:
- Reduced expert discovery from weeks to minutes
- Built systematic expert evaluation framework for model validation
- Domain expert evaluation showed that >88% of the time our new recommendations where preferred over previous manual methods
- Developed LLM judge prototype for automated recommendation assessment


**LLM Integration**: OpenAI API, prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, synthetic data generation
Machine Learning: PyTorch, scikit-learn, embedding models (Specter), recommendation systems, model evaluation
**Knowledge Graphs**: Neo4j, NetworkX, graph algorithms, link prediction, dynamic graph generation
**Data Engineering**: Google BigQuery, Dagster, batch processing pipelines, large-scale data processing
**Infrastructure**: Azure ML Studio, Pytorch Lighning, MLFlow, model deployment, experiment tracking, GitHib Actions CI/CD, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Ray

**Why you will benfit from having me at your Company and Team:**
- **Proven expertise in emerging technologies**: 3+ years building LLM and knowledge graph solutions. 6+ years building professional software solutions.
- **Production-ready mindset:** Focus on building solutions that can scale rather than prototypes that need rebuilding.
- **User-centered approach:** Work directly with domain experts to ensure solutions solve real problems that bring business value, not just technical challenges  
- **Knowledge sharing culture**: Actively present new tools and techniques because I believe knowledge sharing creates awareness, sparks discussion, and leads to better solutions for everyone
- **Innovation Under Uncertainty**: Successfully navigated problems with no clear solutions through analytical thinking and systematic experimentation, demonstrating ability to manage ambiguity and drive innovation


## Solution Areas Where I Add Value
- **AI-Powered Knowledge Management**: Building systems that extract insights from large-scale unstructured data using semantic search, knowledge graphs, and LLM integration to transform raw information into actionable intelligence.
- **Intelligent Search & Recommendation Systems**: Creating advanced search solutions that combine embeddings, graph algorithms, and machine learning to deliver highly relevant results and expert/content recommendations.
- **Trend Analysis & Market Intelligence**: Developing ML systems that identify emerging patterns, competitive insights, and strategic opportunities from complex data sources.
- **RAG & Knowledge-Enhanced AI**: Designing retrieval-augmented generation systems that leverage custom knowledge bases and semantic understanding for domain-specific applications.
- **Production ML & Evaluation Frameworks**: Taking machine learning prototypes to scalable production systems with robust evaluation methodologies and user-centric validation.
- **Agent-Based AI Solutions**: Building autonomous systems that combine multiple AI capabilities (search, analysis, synthesis, tools) to automate complex knowledge work and decision-making processes.

If your team is working on any of these areas, or looking to innovate in adjacent spaces, contact me to drive impactful results together!
